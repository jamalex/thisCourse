glossaryimport = [{"html": "Retinotopy describes the spatial organization of the neuronal responses to visual stimuli. In many locations within the brain, adjacent neurons have receptive fields that include slightly different, but overlapping portions of the visual field. The position of the center of these receptive fields forms an orderly sampling mosaic that covers a portion of the visual field. Because of this orderly arrangement, which emerges from the spatial specificity of connections between neurons in different parts of the visual system, cells in each structure can be seen as forming a map of the visual field (also called a retinotopic map, or a visuotopic map).", "title": "Retinotopic"}, {"html": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method to cause depolarization or hyperpolarization in the neurons of the brain. TMS uses electromagnetic induction to induce weak electric currents using a rapidly changing magnetic field; this can cause activity in specific or general parts of the brain with minimal discomfort, allowing the functioning and interconnections of the brain to be studied. In cognitive neuroscience research TMS is used to produce transient disruption of the function of the targeted areas.", "title": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"}, {"html": "ReinforcerAn operational definition of a positive reinforcer is an outcome that increases the occurrence of a preceding behavior.  Positive reinforcement is closely related to the concept of reward.  Animals and humans will work to receive a positive reinforcer, and the amount of work that an animal or a person will do to receive a positive reinforcer is a good way to judge the reward value of an outcome to that individual at that point in time.A negative reinforcer is also an outcome that increases the occurrence of a preceding behavior, but by alleviating an aversive condition, such as pain or shock.  Negative reinforcement has been linked to the concept of relief.", "title": "Positive and Negative"}, {"html": "Salience is a term that has sometimes been used to describe the extent to which sensory information stands out from the surrounding information and tends to grab our attention.The term is also used to describe the behavioral relevance of information in other words the extent to which it matters! In cognitive neuroscience, researchers acknowledge that salience of information arises from both bottom-up and top-down influences.Bottom-up factors are all those that depend only on the sensory input, without taking into account the internal state of the organism. Top-down control, on the other hand, arises from the internal state of the organism, such as goals, personal history and experiences.Behaviorallytop-down influences guide more efficientsearch towards expected targets.For a good brief discussion of the concept of salience of visual information see:httpwww.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_salience", "title": "Salience"}, {"html": "A progressive neurological disorder that produces a profound impairment of semantic memory, including impaired object naming, and degraded knowledge of specific object properties.", "title": "Semantic Dementia"}, {"html": "Endophenotypes are measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, and have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward - and successful - genetic analysis.(adapted from Gottesman & Gould, 2003)", "title": "endophenotype"}, {"html": "A learning process that occurs when two stimuli are repeatedly paired: a response that is at first elicited by the second stimulus is eventually elicited by the first stimulus alone.", "title": "Classical Conditioning"}, {"html": "A progressive decrease in response to a specific drug concentration, such that increases in concentration are required to maintain the initial response.", "title": "tolerance"}, {"html": "Memory of the rewarding aspects of drug use superimposed on a negative emotional state.", "title": "Craving"}, {"html": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):  a brain imaging technique producing multiple image matrices over several minutes, each of which represents a map of the brain distribution of a functional signal, usually of blood oxygenation.  Since in most cases blood oxygenation varies with blood flow, the values in the images track blood flow changes in the brain over time.  Increased flow is taken as an index of increased neural activity (or activation).", "title": "fMRI"}, {"html": "Functional connectivity analyses of BOLD fMRI data examine the intercorrelations between the signals measured in different parts of the map over time.  Functional connectivity describes the pattern of deviations from statistical independence between distributed and often spatially remote regions.  So, in general, a high correlation between the temporal fluctuation of the signal in a prefrontal region and the temporal fluctuation of the signal in a parietal region would lead to estimates of high functional connectivity between those regions.", "title": "functional connectivity"}, {"html": "Working memory refers to the temporary retention of information that was just experienced or just retrieved from long-term memory but no longer exists in the external environment. These internal representations are short-lived, but can be stored for longer periods of time through active maintenance or rehearsal strategies, and can be subjected to various operations that manipulate the information in such a way that makes it useful for goal-directed behaviour.

Latency to respond (time between onset of target and button press) is usually recorded.  Sometimes a cue stimulus appears before the target.  If that cue appears in the same position as the subsequent target, the target is detected faster.  If it appears in a different position, detection of the subsequent target is slower.", "title": "Spatial Orienting Task"}, {"html": "In talking about emotion, valence means the direction of the emotion, or reward value.

For example in twin studies, it relates to the extent to which monozygotic twins are more similar on a trait than dizygotic twins.Because heritability is a proportion, its numerical value will range from 0.0 (genetic differences do not contribute at all to phenotypic individual differences) to 1.0 (these account for all of the individual differences). Almost all estimates of heritability of behavioral (individual difference) traits that have been shown to be heritable are in the moderate range of .30 to .60Heritability estimates tell you nothing about the actual gene effects, or which genes are involved.Heritability will be higher when the environmental factors that influence the phenotype are relatively constant in the population and lower when they are more variable.", "title": "heritability"}, {"html": "MapMap of activity correlation between the seed area in the <span style=\"color:#008000\">fusiform face area and the rest of the brain during the delay following a face stimulus cue.The pattern is established during the cue and maintained.Maps will differ depending on the nature of the material to be maintained.<img src=\"placeholder.png\" />", "title": "Functional Connectivity"}, {"html": "A type of memory that is expressed through the effects of prior experience on performance, rather than conscious recall.
