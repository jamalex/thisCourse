Goals:
	be able to see how much space a user/course is using
	allow user to browse their uploaded media files, to select one to insert
	deduplicate multiple uploads of same file, to save space
	when a file is no longer used/pointed to, delete it?
	

Ideas:
	have an /api/file/ collection, which stores metadata, and urls
	no direct links to the S3 urls, all requests go through a redirect url that generates an expiring S3 link
	if needed, could have thumbnail generation be server-side, in batch mode (using full image in the interim)
	deduplication could also be server-side, with renaming happening in batch mode -- and seamless url updating
